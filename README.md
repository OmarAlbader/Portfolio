# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running Multiple React Projects

To run both the Amthal project and Portfolio project simultaneously:

1. First, start the Amthal project:

```bash
cd path/to/amthal
npm run start
```

2. Then, in a new terminal, start the Portfolio project:

```bash
cd path/to/portfolio
npm run start
```

Note: Since the default port 3000 will be used by the first project, the second project will automatically run on port 3001.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
